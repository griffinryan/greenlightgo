## greenlightgo builds using:

- [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl) - a 3D framework to use OpenGL bindings in Golang

### Overview

This project is intended to showcase an understanding of 3D game engine development using OpenGL and Golang, such as liner algebra and natural lighting concepts.

#### Get Started

Clone the repo and build with [go](https://github.com/golang/go)!

    git clone git@github.com:griffinryan/greenlightgo.git
    cd greenlightgo/

---

If you want to install `greenlightgo` just to run it:

    go install
    go run src/main.go

If you want to install all of the [g3n](http://g3n.rocks) dependencies to continue development of `greenlightgo`:

    go get -u github.com/go-gl/...
    go install
    go run src/main.go
